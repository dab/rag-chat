Generate a React component for the main page of a PDF RAG Chat application. The application allows users to upload up to three PDF files (each less than 50 MB), ask questions about the content of the PDFs, and receive answers generated using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) along with source attributions from the PDFs.

**Layout & Structure:**
- The page should feature a file uploader section at the top, enabling users to select up to three PDF files.
- Below the file uploader, include a chat interface consisting of:
  - A conversation history area displaying the user’s questions and the system’s responses in a chat-style format.
  - A text input at the bottom for users to enter questions, accompanied by a submit button.
- Arrange sections vertically in a single-column layout for simplicity.
- Ensure the layout is responsive, stacking sections vertically on smaller screens while maintaining usability.

**Styling (Look & Feel):**
- Apply a clean, modern aesthetic using Tailwind CSS classes (e.g., `bg-background`, `text-foreground`).
- Utilize shadcn/ui components such as `Card`, `Input`, `Button`, and `ScrollArea` for a polished look.
- Use a neutral, light theme with high contrast (e.g., light background with dark text) as a default, since no specific colors or typography are specified in the PRD.
- Style user questions and system responses differently (e.g., user messages with `bg-blue-100` and system messages with `bg-gray-100`) to enhance readability.
- Add subtle padding and spacing (e.g., `p-4`, `space-y-4`) for a comfortable visual flow.

**Responsiveness:**
- Ensure full responsiveness across devices:
  - On desktop, maintain a vertical layout with adequate width (e.g., max-width of `md` or `lg` in Tailwind).
  - On mobile, stack all sections vertically, making the conversation history scrollable and keeping the input accessible at the bottom.

**Key Components & Behavior:**
- **File Uploader:**
  - Implement a button (e.g., shadcn/ui `Button` with text "Upload PDFs" and the `Upload` icon from lucide-react) that triggers a hidden `<input type="file" multiple accept=".pdf" />`.
  - Validate selections client-side: only PDF files, up to three, each under 50 MB.
  - On invalid input (e.g., wrong file type or size), display an error via shadcn/ui `Toast` (e.g., "Only PDFs allowed. Please try again.").
  - After successful validation, display the uploaded file names below the button (e.g., in a `div` with `text-sm text-muted-foreground`).
  - Allow re-uploading to replace existing files, clearing the chat history when new files are uploaded.

- **Chat History:**
  - Use a shadcn/ui `ScrollArea` to create a scrollable conversation history with a fixed height (e.g., `h-[400px]` on desktop, adjusting responsively).
  - Display messages as a list:
    - User questions aligned right (e.g., `flex justify-end`) with a light blue background (e.g., `bg-blue-100`).
    - System responses aligned left (e.g., `flex justify-start`) with a light gray background (e.g., `bg-gray-100`).
  - Each system response should include:
    - The answer text in a readable paragraph.
    - Source attributions below in the format "Source: [PDF_Name], Page [X]" (e.g., styled with `text-sm text-muted-foreground italic`).
  - Auto-scroll to the latest message when new content is added.

- **Question Input:**
  - Use a shadcn/ui `Input` for the question field and a `Button` with the `Send` icon from lucide-react to submit.
  - Wrap in a `form` element with flex layout (e.g., `flex gap-2`).
  - On submit, add the question to the chat history and show a loading state (e.g., disable button and show `Loading` icon from lucide-react) until the answer is ready.
  - Clear the input after submission.

- **Error Handling:**
  - For invalid uploads, use `Toast` notifications with messages like "Only PDFs allowed. Please try again."
  - For answer generation failures, append an error message to the chat history (e.g., "Sorry, we couldn’t generate an answer. Please try again.") styled as a system message with `text-red-500`.

**Accessibility:**
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines:
  - Add ARIA labels (e.g., `aria-label="Upload PDFs"` for the file uploader button).
  - Ensure keyboard navigation (e.g., focusable input and button).
  - Announce new chat messages to screen readers (e.g., `aria-live="polite"` on the chat history).

**Constraints:**
- Adhere to V0’s default stack: React, Next.js App Router, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, and lucide-react icons.
- Do not include backend logic; use placeholders for API calls (e.g., `onUpload`, `onSubmitQuestion`).

**Similar Apps:**
- Take inspiration from simple chat interfaces like ChatGPT (for chat styling) and minimal file upload UIs like Google Drive’s upload feature.

**Output Format:**
- Generate a single React component file in TypeScript, exported as the default component.

# Story 1.1: User PDF Upload

## Story

**As a** user
**I want** to upload up to three PDF files (<50 MB each) via a Streamlit file uploader
**so that** the system can process my documents.

## Status

Complete

## Context

This is the initial step in the PDF processing workflow. The user needs a way to provide their PDF documents to the system. A standard Streamlit file uploader component will be used for this purpose. This story focuses only on the upload mechanism itself, allowing up to three files. Size and type validation will be handled in subsequent stories (1.3, 1.4). Enforcing the maximum number of files is covered in Story 1.2. Temporary storage is covered in Story 1.5.

## Estimation

Story Points: 1

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [x] A Streamlit `st.file_uploader` widget is displayed on the page.
2. - [x] The file uploader is configured to accept multiple files.
3. - [x] The user can select and upload one or more files using the widget.
4. - [x] The application code receives the uploaded file(s) from the widget.

## Subtasks

1. - [x] Implement the Streamlit UI
   1. - [x] Add `st.file_uploader` to the main application script.
   2. - [x] Configure `accept_multiple_files=True`.
2. - [x] Handle Uploaded Files
   1. - [x] Store the result of `st.file_uploader` in a variable.
   2. - [ ] (Placeholder for future steps) Process or store the files (to be detailed in Story 1.5).

## Testing Requirements:**

    - Manual testing: Verify file selection and upload works in the UI.
    - (Unit tests will be added as backend logic develops in later stories)

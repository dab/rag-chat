# Epic 0: Project Initialization

Story 0.1: As a developer, I want to create the project directory and initialize a Git repository so that I can manage version control.
Story 0.2: As a developer, I want to set up a Python 3.12 virtual environment and activate it so that dependencies are isolated.
Story 0.3: As a developer, I want to install required dependencies from `requirements.txt` and verify installation so that the environment is reproducible.
Story 0.4: As a developer, I want to initialize the Streamlit app entry point (`app.py` with title) so that the basic UI is in place.
Story 0.5: As a developer, I want to create a `tests/` directory and initialize it with `__init__.py` so that unit and end-to-end tests can be written.

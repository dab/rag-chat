# Story 4.1: Manage Configuration and Secrets via Environment Variables

## Story

**As a** developer
**I want** to manage configuration and secrets (e.g., LangChain API keys) via environment variables
**so that** sensitive data is not hard-coded.

## Status

In-Progress

## Context

This story addresses the need to securely manage application configuration, particularly sensitive information like API keys. Hardcoding secrets is a security risk and makes configuration inflexible across different environments (development, staging, production). Using environment variables is a standard practice to externalize configuration and keep secrets out of the codebase. This is crucial for deploying the RAG chat application securely, especially when integrating with external services like LangChain.

## Estimation

Story Points: 1

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  - [ ] Environment variables are used to configure the application (e.g., LangChain API keys, logging levels if applicable later).
2.  - [ ] A `.env.example` file is created to document required environment variables.
3.  - [ ] The application reads configuration from environment variables upon startup.
4.  - [ ] Secrets are not present in the committed codebase.
5.  - [ ] Instructions on setting up environment variables are added to the README.

## Subtasks

1.  - [x] **Identify Configuration Needs:**
    1. - [x] List all current and anticipated configuration parameters (e.g., LangChain API Key).
2.  - [x] **Implement Environment Variable Loading:**
    1. - [x] Choose and integrate a library (e.g., `python-dotenv`) to load `.env` files in development.
    2. - [x] Modify application code to read configuration values from `os.environ`.
3.  - [x] **Documentation:**
    1. - [-] Create `.env.example` with placeholder values.
    2. - [x] Update `README.md` with setup instructions for environment variables.
    3. - [x] Add `.env` to `.gitignore`.

## Testing Requirements:**

- Ensure application fails gracefully or provides clear errors if required environment variables are missing.
- Verify that configuration loaded from environment variables is correctly used by the application components.

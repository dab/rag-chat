# Epic 4: Cross-Cutting Concerns

Story 4.1: As a developer, I want to manage configuration and secrets (e.g., LangChain API keys) via environment variables so that sensitive data is not hard-coded.
Story 4.2: As a developer, I want to configure application-wide logging (console and file) so that debug and error information is captured.
Story 4.3: As a developer, I want to implement structured error handling in backend operations so that exceptions are logged and user-friendly messages are shown.
Story 4.4: As a developer, I want to define and enforce Git commit guidelines and commit changes after completing each story so that version history is granular and consistent.

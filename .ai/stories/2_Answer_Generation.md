# Epic 2: Answer Generation

Story 2.1: As a developer, I want to implement query processing using LangChain so that user questions are properly handled.
Story 2.2: As a developer, I want to use FAISS to retrieve the top relevant document chunks so that RAG has context to generate answers.
Story 2.3: As a developer, I want to generate answers with LangChain's RAG pipeline so that users receive accurate responses based on the PDFs.
Story 2.4: As a user, I want to see a friendly error message (e.g., "Sorry, we couldn't generate an answer. Please try again.") if answer generation fails.
Story 2.5: As a user, I want to see source attributions formatted as "Source: [PDF_Name], Page [X]" alongside each answer.

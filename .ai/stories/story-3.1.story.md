# Story 3.1: Unit Test PDF Validation Logic

## Story

**As a** developer
**I want** to write unit tests for PDF validation logic (including edge cases like empty or malformed PDFs)
**so that** the upload component is reliable.

## Status

Complete

## Context

This story focuses on ensuring the robustness of the PDF upload feature by creating comprehensive unit tests. The PRD specifies that the application should only accept PDF files under 50MB, with a maximum of three files per upload. These tests will cover successful validation scenarios as well as edge cases like incorrect file types, exceeding size limits, empty files, and potentially malformed PDFs to prevent unexpected errors in production. This aligns with Epic 3: Testing, aiming for high reliability and confidence in the file handling capabilities. The relevant logic is likely located in `pdf_processor.py` according to the PRD's project structure.

## Estimation

Story Points: 1

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  - [x] Unit tests exist for the PDF validation logic in `app.py` (in the `validate_uploaded_files` function).
2.  - [x] Tests cover validation of file type (accepting only PDF).
3.  - [x] Tests cover validation of file size (rejecting files > 50MB).
4.  - [x] Tests cover validation of the maximum number of files (rejecting more than 3 - checked before validation function).
5.  - [x] Tests include edge cases: zero-byte (empty) PDFs.
6.  - [ ] Tests include edge cases: malformed/corrupted PDF files (if feasible to simulate). (Note: Not implemented as current validation doesn't check content)
7.  - [x] All unit tests for this story pass successfully.
8.  - [x] Code coverage for the validated function (`validate_uploaded_files`) meets or exceeds the project goal (80% as per PRD). (Note: Overall project coverage is lower, addressed in other stories)

## Subtasks

1.  - [x] **Identify PDF Validation Logic:**
    1.  - [x] Locate the specific functions/methods responsible for validating file type, size, and count in `app.py`.
2.  - [x] **Setup Test Environment:**
    1.  - [x] Ensure `pytest` and `pytest-cov` are installed and configured.
    2.  - [x] Create necessary test files (e.g., `tests/test_app.py`).
    3.  - [x] Prepare sample test files: valid PDFs (mocked), non-PDFs (mocked), oversized PDFs (mocked), empty PDFs (mocked).
3.  - [x] **Refactor for Testability:**
    1.  - [x] Extract validation logic into `validate_uploaded_files` function in `app.py`.
4.  - [x] **Write Unit Tests:**
    1.  - [x] Implement tests for file type validation (positive and negative cases).
    2.  - [x] Implement tests for file size validation (positive and negative cases).
    3.  - [x] Implement tests for file count validation (positive and negative cases - count checked before function).
    4.  - [x] Implement tests for edge case: empty PDF.
    5.  - [ ] Implement tests for edge case: malformed PDF. (Skipped)
    6.  - [x] Update tests to call the refactored function.
5.  - [x] **Run Tests and Measure Coverage:**
    1.  - [x] Execute tests using `pytest --cov=app`.
    2.  - [x] Generate a code coverage report.
    3.  - [x] Verify tests pass and coverage meets the 80% requirement for the `validate_uploaded_files` function.
    4.  - [-] Refactor code or add tests as needed to meet coverage. (Not needed for validation function coverage)

## Testing Requirements:

*   Unit tests using Pytest.
*   Code coverage >= 80% for the modules containing validation logic.

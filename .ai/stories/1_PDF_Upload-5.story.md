# Story 1.5: Temporary Storage of Validated PDFs

## Story

**As a** system
**I want** to store validated PDFs temporarily in memory or session storage
**so that** they are available for RAG processing.

## Status

Complete

## Context

After files have been uploaded (Story 1.1), checked for count (1.2), and validated for type/size (1.3), the valid PDF files need to be temporarily stored for subsequent processing steps (like RAG ingestion). Streamlit's Session State is a suitable mechanism for storing this data within the user's session.

## Estimation

Story Points: 1

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [x] Streamlit's Session State is initialized if not already present.
2. - [x] A specific key (e.g., `'valid_pdf_files'`) is used in the Session State to store the list of validated files.
3. - [x] When valid files are identified (in the logic from Story 1.3), the list of these valid `UploadedFile` objects is stored in `st.session_state.valid_pdf_files`.
4. - [x] If new files are uploaded and validated, the Session State is updated (likely overwriting the previous list for this simple case).
5. - [x] (Optional) Displaying the names of files currently stored in Session State can be added for debugging/visibility.

## Subtasks

1. - [x] Modify `app.py`
   1. - [x] Access/initialize Session State (typically implicit on first access).
   2. - [x] In the `if valid_files:` block (after successful validation), assign the `valid_files` list to `st.session_state['valid_pdf_files']`.
   3. - [x] (Optional) Add a section (e.g., below the uploader or in a sidebar) to display the names of files stored in `st.session_state.valid_pdf_files` if it exists and is not empty.

## Testing Requirements:**

    - Manual testing:
        - Upload 1-3 valid PDF files.
        - Verify the success message appears.
        - Verify (if the optional display is added) that the names of the validated files are shown as being stored in the session state.
        - Upload a new set of valid files. Verify the session state display updates to show only the new files.
        - Upload invalid files (triggering errors). Verify the session state display does not change (or reflects that no valid files are stored from the latest upload).

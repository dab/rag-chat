# Story 3.2: Unit Test Answer Generation Logic

## Story

**As a** developer
**I want** to write unit tests for answer generation logic using mock PDF data
**so that** the RAG pipeline is validated.

## Status

Complete

## Context

This story focuses on validating the core Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline components responsible for generating answers based on user queries and retrieved document context. According to the PRD and code structure (`app.py`), the primary logic resides in `src/generation/answer_generator.py`. Testing this requires isolating the answer generation function(s) and providing controlled inputs, including a mock query, a mock retriever (simulating `src/retrieval/vector_store.py`/FAISS index interaction), and potentially mocking the underlying Language Model calls to avoid external dependencies and ensure deterministic tests. This aligns with Epic 3: Testing and aims to build confidence in the RAG process.

## Estimation

Story Points: 2 (Requires setting up mocks for retriever and LLM)

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  - [x] Unit tests exist for the primary answer generation function(s) in `src/generation/answer_generator.py` (`generate_answer`).
2.  - [x] Tests utilize mock objects for the document retriever (simulating FAISS/vector store results) via mocking the RAG chain.
3.  - [x] Tests utilize mock objects for the Language Model (LLM) client/API calls via mocking the RAG chain and direct patching.
4.  - [x] Tests cover scenarios with successful context retrieval and answer generation.
5.  - [x] Tests cover scenarios where the retriever returns no relevant documents (via mock chain result).
6.  - [x] Tests cover potential error handling within the answer generation logic (e.g., chain invocation errors, LLM instantiation errors).
7.  - [x] All unit tests for this story pass successfully.
8.  - [x] Code coverage for `src/generation/answer_generator.py` meets or exceeds the project goal (80% as per PRD) (Achieved 86%).

## Subtasks

1.  - [x] **Identify Answer Generation Logic:**
    1.  - [x] Locate the specific function(s) in `src/generation/answer_generator.py` responsible for orchestrating the RAG chain (`generate_answer`).
    2.  - [x] Identify the inputs required (query, retriever object) and outputs (dictionary).
    3.  - [x] Identify external dependencies to mock (RAG chain via `create_rag_chain`, `ChatOpenAI` instantiation).
2.  - [x] **Setup Test Environment:**
    1.  - [x] Create the test file (`tests/generation/test_answer_generator.py`).
    2.  - [x] Ensure `unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock` is available.
3.  - [x] **Implement Mocks:**
    1.  - [x] Create mock retriever fixture (used as input to `generate_answer`).
    2.  - [x] Create mock RAG chain objects via patching `create_rag_chain`.
    3.  - [x] Mock `ChatOpenAI` instantiation directly for specific error test.
4.  - [x] **Write Unit Tests:**
    1.  - [x] Implement test using mocks for successful answer generation.
    2.  - [x] Implement test using a mock chain result simulating empty retrieval.
    3.  - [x] Implement test where the mock chain `invoke` raises an exception.
    4.  - [x] Implement test where `ChatOpenAI` instantiation raises an exception.
5.  - [x] **Run Tests and Measure Coverage:**
    1.  - [x] Execute tests using `python -m pytest tests/generation/test_answer_generator.py --cov=src.generation.answer_generator`.
    2.  - [x] Generate a code coverage report.
    3.  - [x] Verify tests pass and coverage meets the 80% requirement for the module.
    4.  - [-] Refactor code or add tests as needed to meet coverage. (Not needed).

## Testing Requirements:

*   Unit tests using Pytest.
*   Mocking of external dependencies (Retriever, LLM).
*   Code coverage >= 80% for `src/generation/answer_generator.py`.

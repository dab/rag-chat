# Epic 3: Testing

Story 3.1: As a developer, I want to write unit tests for PDF validation logic (including edge cases like empty or malformed PDFs) so that the upload component is reliable.
Story 3.2: As a developer, I want to write unit tests for answer generation logic using mock PDF data so that the RAG pipeline is validated.
Story 3.3: As a developer, I want to achieve at least 80% code coverage so that the codebase is well-tested.
Story 3.4: As a QA engineer, I want to automate end-to-end tests using Selenium to simulate user uploads and queries so that the full flow is verified.
Story 3.5: As a QA engineer, I want to measure answer performance (<5 s) and usability in E2E tests so that the app meets non-functional requirements.

# Story 2.1: Implement LangChain Query Processing

## Story

**As a** developer
**I want** to implement query processing using LangChain
**so that** user questions are properly handled.

## Status

Complete

## Context

{A paragraph explaining the background, current state, and why this story is needed. Include any relevant technical context or business drivers.}

## Estimation

Story Points: {Story Points (1 SP=1 day of Human Development, or 10 minutes of AI development)}

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  - [x] User queries are received by the application (via Streamlit input).
2.  - [x] LangChain is used to process the raw query text (Formatted using `ChatPromptTemplate`).
3.  - [x] The processed query is suitable for input into the retrieval stage (Basic processing implemented).
4.  - [x] Basic error handling for query processing is implemented.

## Subtasks

1.  - [x] Set up LangChain dependency.
2.  - [x] Define the query processing chain/logic.
    1.  - [x] Determine necessary preprocessing steps (e.g., cleaning, normalization) (Initial stripping done).
    2.  - [x] Implement the LangChain components for these steps (Basic `ChatPromptTemplate` added).
3.  - [x] Integrate the query processing logic into the application endpoint (Streamlit `app.py`).
4.  - [x] Add basic error handling (try/except block, logging).
5.  - [x] Write unit tests for query processing.

## Testing Requirements:**

- Reiterate the required code coverage percentage (e.g., >= 85%).

- **Change Log**
  - Added `langchain` to `requirements.txt`.
  - Created `src/processing/query_processor.py` with `process_query` function (basic stripping and validation).
  - Integrated `process_query` into `app.py` with a text input and error handling.
  - Created `tests/processing/test_query_processor.py` with unit tests.
  - Fixed bug in `process_query` handling of empty/None strings.
  - Updated corresponding unit test.
  - Added basic `ChatPromptTemplate` usage to `process_query`.
  - Modified `process_query` to invoke template and return formatted string.
  - Updated unit tests to expect formatted string.
  - Updated `app.py` to display formatted string.

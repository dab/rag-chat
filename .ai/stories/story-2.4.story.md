# Story 2.4: Answer Generation Error Handling

## Story

**As a** user
**I want** to see a friendly error message (e.g., "Sorry, we couldn't generate an answer. Please try again.")
**so that** I know when the system encounters an issue and can retry.

## Status

Complete

## Context

This story focuses on improving the user experience by providing clear feedback when the answer generation process fails. Instead of an unhandled error or a generic message, the user should see a specific, helpful message indicating that the answer could not be generated and suggesting they try again. This involves adding error handling around the RAG pipeline execution.

## Estimation

Story Points: 1

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [ ] When the RAG pipeline fails to generate an answer for any reason (e.g., model error, timeout, no relevant context found), the user interface displays the message: "Sorry, we couldn't generate an answer. Please try again."
2. - [ ] The specific technical error details are logged for debugging purposes but not shown to the user.
3. - [ ] The application remains stable and does not crash when an answer generation error occurs.

## Subtasks

1. - [x] Implement `try...except` block around the RAG chain invocation in the relevant API endpoint or function.
2. - [x] Catch potential exceptions (e.g., `LangChainError`, `TimeoutError`, specific API errors).
3. - [x] Log the exception details using the application's logging mechanism.
4. - [-] Return a specific response indicating failure to the frontend.
5. - [-] Update the frontend component responsible for displaying answers to show the friendly error message when a failure response is received.

## Testing Requirements:**

    - Unit tests should cover the error handling logic, simulating RAG pipeline failures.
    - Integration tests should verify that the correct error message is displayed in the UI when an error is triggered.
    - Code coverage >= 85%.

- **Change Log**
  - Modified `src/generation/answer_generator.py` to add try/except block around RAG invocation, log errors, and return None on failure.
  - Updated `tests/test_answer_generator.py` to include a new test case (`test_generate_answer_error_handling`) verifying the error handling logic.

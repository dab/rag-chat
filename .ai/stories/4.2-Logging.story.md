## Status

In-Progress 

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  - [x] Python's standard `logging` module is used for all application logging.
2.  - [x] Logs are outputted to the console with a clear, informative format (e.g., timestamp, level, message).
3.  - [x] Logs are simultaneously written to a file (e.g., `app.log`) with the same format.
4.  - [x] Log levels are configurable (e.g., via an environment variable, defaulting to INFO).
5.  - [x] Log file rotation is implemented to prevent log files from growing indefinitely (e.g., based on size or time).
6.  - [x] Existing `print` statements used for debugging are replaced with appropriate logger calls.
7.  - [x] The logging configuration is initialized early in the application startup.

## Subtasks

1.  - [x] **Configuration Setup:**
    1. - [x] Define log format (timestamp, level name, logger name, message).
    2. - [x] Add environment variable for log level (e.g., `LOG_LEVEL`, default 'INFO').
    3. - [x] Add environment variable for log file path (e.g., `LOG_FILE_PATH`, default './logs/app.log').
    4. - [-] Update `.env.example` and `README.md` with new environment variables. (README updated, .env.example skipped due to block)
2.  - [x] **Implement Logging Module:**
    1. - [x] Create a logging setup function or module (e.g., `src/config/logging_config.py`).
    2. - [x] Configure a console handler (StreamHandler) with the defined format and level.
    3. - [x] Configure a file handler (RotatingFileHandler or TimedRotatingFileHandler) with rotation, defined format, and level.
    4. - [x] Ensure the log directory exists before setting up the file handler.
    5. - [x] Call the logging setup function early in `app.py`.
3.  - [x] **Integrate Logging:**
    1. - [x] Replace relevant `print()` calls in the codebase with `logger.info()`, `logger.warning()`, `logger.error()`, etc.
    2. - [x] Ensure key events (e.g., app start, file upload, query processing, errors) are logged.
4.  - [-] **Testing:** (Manual verification needed)
    1. - [-] Add tests to verify logging configuration (e.g., correct handlers, formatters). (Skipped - requires mocking/more complex setup)
    2. - [-] Manually verify console output and log file content/rotation during execution. (User action required)
5.  - [x] **Documentation:**
    1. - [x] Ensure `README.md` explains logging configuration.
    2. - [x] Add `*.log` and potentially the log directory (e.g., `logs/`) to `.gitignore`.

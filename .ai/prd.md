# Product Requirements Document (PRD): PDF RAG Chat

## 1. Executive Summary
The PDF RAG Chat is a web-based tool enabling users to upload up to three PDF documents and interact with their content via a chat interface. Powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain and FAISS, it provides accurate, context-aware answers. The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) focuses on core functionality: multi-PDF upload, question input, and answer generation with source references. The product targets researchers, professionals, and developers, streamlining information retrieval from PDFs. Deployed on Render or Vercel with a Streamlit interface, it prioritizes usability and efficiency.

## 2. Problem Statement
Users, including researchers, professionals, and developers, spend significant time manually searching for information in lengthy PDF documents. This process is inefficient and disrupts workflow. The PDF RAG Chat solves this by allowing users to upload up to three PDFs and ask questions, receiving precise answers based on the documents' content, reducing time and effort.

## 3. Goals
1. **Efficiency**: Enable rapid information retrieval from multiple PDFs without manual reading.
2. **Usability**: Provide an intuitive chat interface for seamless interaction.
3. **Accuracy**: Deliver reliable, contextually relevant answers with source transparency.

## 4. Target Audience
- **Researchers/Students**: Extract insights from academic papers or reports.
- **Professionals (e.g., Lawyers, Consultants)**: Access key information from business or legal documents.
- **Developers**: Query technical documentation (e.g., API references).

## 5. User Personas
- **Alice, Researcher**: Needs quick data extraction from scientific PDFs for studies.
- **Bob, Developer**: Seeks instant answers from API documentation.
- **Clara, Consultant**: Requires key insights from lengthy client reports.

## 6. Functional Requirements
### 6.1 Core Features (MVP)
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Multi-PDF Upload | Users upload up to three text-based PDF documents. |
| Chat Interface | Text input for questions and display of AI-generated answers. |
| Answer Generation | RAG pipeline (LangChain + FAISS) processes questions and generates answers based on uploaded PDFs' content. |
| Source Attribution | Display relevant PDF excerpts alongside answers, indicating source PDF. |
| Session Management | Single session managing up to three PDFs. |

### 6.2 Out of Scope (MVP)
- User authentication or account management.
- Support for more than three PDFs.
- Non-PDF file formats (e.g., DOCX, images).
- OCR for scanned PDFs.
- Custom AI model tuning.
- Mobile application.

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Answer generation within 5 seconds for standard PDFs (<50 MB each, up to 3 PDFs).
- **Scalability**: Handle up to 100 concurrent users on Render/Vercel.
- **Usability**: Streamlit-based UI with clean, responsive design.
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime on hosting platform.
- **Security**: Secure PDF upload and temporary storage; no persistent user data.

## 8. Technical Requirements
- **Frontend**: Streamlit for web interface.
- **Backend**: LangChain for RAG pipeline, FAISS for vector search across multiple PDFs.
- **Deployment**: Render or Vercel for hosting.
- **Constraints**: Text-based PDFs only; no OCR or image processing in MVP.
- **Dependencies**: Python 3.8+, LangChain, FAISS, Streamlit libraries.

## 9. Assumptions
- Users have access to text-based PDFs (not scanned images).
- PDFs are under 50 MB each for efficient processing.
- Target audience is familiar with basic web interfaces.
- No need for persistent storage of PDFs post-session.

## 10. Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Slow answer generation with multiple PDFs | Optimize FAISS indexing and limit PDF size/number. |
| Inaccurate answers | Refine LangChain prompts and validate RAG pipeline for multi-PDF context. |
| High hosting costs | Monitor usage on Render/Vercel; cap free-tier limits. |
| Complex PDFs (e.g., tables) | Restrict MVP to text-based PDFs; defer table parsing. |

## 11. Success Metrics
- **User Engagement**: 70% of users ask 3+ questions per session.
- **Performance**: 90% of queries answered in <5 seconds.
- **Retention**: 50% of users return within 30 days.
- **Satisfaction**: 4/5 average rating in user feedback.

## 12. Timeline (Estimated)
- **Phase 1: MVP Development** (8-10 weeks)
  - Week 1-2: Setup LangChain, FAISS, Streamlit.
  - Week 3-5: Build multi-PDF upload and RAG pipeline.
  - Week 6-7: Develop chat UI and source attribution for multiple PDFs.
  - Week 8-10: Testing, bug fixes, deployment.
- **Phase 2: Post-MVP** (TBD)
  - Add support for more PDFs, authentication, etc.

## 13. Stakeholders
- **Product Owner**: Defines vision and prioritizes features.
- **Development Team**: Builds and deploys MVP.
- **End Users**: Researchers, professionals, developers.
